    "## Problem Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "A truck is used for smuggling operations across the Uruguay-Brazil border in Rocha (Chuy). The operation involves:\n",
    "- **Multiple border crossings** between pickup points (suppliers in Brazil) and delivery points (warehouses in Uruguay)\n",
    "- **Limited truck capacity** for transporting goods\n",
    "- **Risk accumulation** at each border crossing\n",

    "- Each location can only be visited once (except depot)\n",
    "- Truck has maximum volume capacity\n",
    "- Each warehouse has maximum storage capacity\n",
    "- Total accumulated risk must not exceed threshold\n",
    "- Route must start and end at depot (location 0)\n",

    "\n",
    "- $z_{ij} \\in \\{0,1\\}$: Binary variable, 1 if truck travels from $i$ to $j$\n",
    "- $c_{k,i}^+ \\in \\mathbb{R}_{\\geq 0}$: Quantity of product $k$ picked up at location $i$\n",
    "- $c_{k,i}^- \\in \\mathbb{R}_{\\geq 0}$: Quantity of product $k$ delivered at location $i$\n",

    "- **`level`**: Depth in the search tree (number of decisions made)\n",

    "\n",
    "This class implements the Branch and Bound algorithm for solving the smuggling route optimization problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Algorithm Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "**Branch and Bound** is an exact optimization method that systematically explores the solution space using:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Branching**: Generating child nodes by making decisions (visit location, pickup/deliver goods)\n",
    "2. **Bounding**: Computing upper bounds on achievable profit to enable pruning\n",
    "3. **Pruning**: Discarding branches where `bound ≤ best_value` (cannot improve solution)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`solve()`**: Main algorithm loop using priority queue (heap) to explore most promising nodes first\n",
    "- **`create_root_node()`**: Initializes search with empty solution at depot\n",
    "- **`branch(node)`**: Generates child nodes by deciding next location and pickup/delivery actions\n",
    "- **`compute_bound(node)`**: Calculates optimistic upper bound: `current_profit + value_in_truck + remaining_stock_value`\n",
    "- **`is_feasible(node)`**: Checks all constraints (capacity, risk, storage limits)\n",
    "- **`is_complete_solution(node)`**: Checks if route returns to depot\n",
    "- **`should_explore(node)`**: Pruning condition: `node.bound > best_value`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Branching Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "At each location:\n",
    "- **Suppliers** (abroad=1): Generate two branches\n",
    "  - Pick up maximum possible of each good (greedy by profit/volume ratio)\n",
    "  - Skip location (pickup nothing)\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Warehouses** (abroad=0): Generate two branches\n",
    "  - Deliver maximum possible respecting warehouse capacity\n",
    "  - Keep goods in truck (deliver nothing)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: This greedy branching strategy (max pickup/delivery or nothing) does not guarantee optimality but significantly reduces the branching factor compared to exploring all possible quantity combinations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Upper Bound Calculation\n",
    "\n",
    "The bound is computed optimistically as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$bound = \\text{profit\\_delivered} + \\sum_{k} q_k \\cdot G_k + \\sum_{k,i} A_{k,i}^{remaining} \\cdot G_k$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This assumes:\n",
    "- All goods currently in truck will be delivered\n",
    "- All remaining stock can be picked up and delivered\n",
    "- No capacity or storage constraints bind\n",
    "\n",
    "This optimism enables effective pruning while guaranteeing no optimal solutions are discarded."
